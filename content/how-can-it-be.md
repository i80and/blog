How can the Church, led by inspiration and the Glory of the Holy Spirit, act as
Sodom? How can the Holy Spirit allow her to create so much pain and death and
darkness?

<p style="font-style: italic;margin-left: 1em">
If it were his intention<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and he withdrew his spirit and breath,<br />
all humanity would perish together<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and mankind would return to the dust.</p>

I'm so tired.

I'm so tired of pretending that it makes sense.

I'm so tired of "tolerating" brothers and sisters who hate me and those
I love.

But Christ's resurrection is a light. His Church may be dim, but Him
I can follow.
